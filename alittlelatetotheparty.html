        <p class="reg-posts">Well I never would have thought I would be typing my own posts to a personal website.
        Or to even have a personal website at all. Frankly I believed those computer science lessons during college on "website scripting" were a waste of my time.
        I would have much rather did some "real" coding and did something cool like make some "real" games. Well it seems the scripting came in handy and I ended up
        doing that "real" coding for "real" games as a career. Or soon enough atleast.</p>
        <p class="reg-posts">I am currently a university student studying Games Design and Development. At a healthy 18 years of age and 1 year completed in my first
        step as a game developer, everything just became that much more real. Being a game developer was something I had always dreamt of, but never believed
        to be something I would pursue. 12-year-old me would be absolutely infatuated with his future choices and chosen path.</p>

        <p class="reg-posts">Compiling one's thoughts is a great method in collecting every little detail required in understanding your own thought process. 
            Posting them onto a public page is a recent innovation, and it has been done by a myriad of individuals since the dawn of the world wide web. 
            And without a doubt, it amazes me every single time I end up on some random fellow's page, breaking down concepts and personal thoughts based on 
            a topic I had absolutely no interest in only 5 minutes ago. And somehow I find myself obsessed over the same topic, digging myself deep into this newly introduced rabbit hole</p>
        <p class="reg-posts">My page will certainly contain plenty of rambling on whatever interests me at the moment. And hopefully I will document it all for my own interest.
            I already have a habit of journaling. Surely this could not be much different? Hopefully this doesn't sound as cheesy as it does in my head but, I hope this little
            webpage of mine can become the home for all my thoughts and interests into this ever expanding world we all reside in. And with this, I leave a quote:</p>
        <p class="reg">“I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent—no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.” – Seneca</p>
