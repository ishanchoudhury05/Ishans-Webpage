        <p class="reg" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 465px;">Genre: High Score Arcade Game</p>
        <p class="reg" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 465px;">Info: This game was my first solo project. It was nominated for the Digital Shark Expo at The University Of Greenwich 2024. It was initially made for my Object-Oriented Programming module and did pretty well. It's a simple arcade-style game where you play towards a new highscore. It has a heavy focus on polished mechanics over aesthetics. Although I think it looks quite nice. Finished 22/04/24</p>

        <p class="reg" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 465px; text-align: right">Info: This game was my first group project (trio). It was developed for much longer than the previous game, with development starting before H!IAACBCBES. It definitely had a LOT of ups and downs during development, and looking back at my own methodology and implementation of features make me cringe. However, the process taught me a lot and I had loads of fun working on it. Thanks for the memories Agent Bonanza. Submitted 03/04/24 but tweaked and showcased 22/05/24</p>
