<p class="reg-posts">I used to have a side-hustle building computers for friends and family. I had built a few before even considering to build my own.
					 Around 2020, I finally commit and built a PC I could call my own. It wasn't the fastest, even for it's time period. Since then, the
					 majority of the parts have been upgraded since to slightly more capable components. Growing up with cheap netbooks meant I played
					 many older titles such as morrowind, half life and many more. Ironically when I had built a more capable machine, I spent more time
					 playing my collection of nostalgic old games at higher settings and mods than playing newer modern titles. Nontheless, Here is the 
					 list of current components:</p>
<p class="reg-posts">CPU - i7-8700k (Overclocked to 5.2Ghz)
				 <br>GPU - GTX 1660 6GB GDDR5
				 <br>RAM - 32GB DDR4 3200Mhz
				 <br>Motherboard - ROG STRIX Z390-H Gaming
				 <br>Case - Lian Li 011 Air Mini (White)
				 <br>Storage - 256GB M.2 NVME SSD, 1TB 7200RPM HDD</p>

<p class="reg-posts">But what is a computer without a desk to sit at and peripherals to input with? I've had a myriad of different types of computers

                     My desk setup however, changing as much as it had, never saw any substancial upgrades for many years. That is until recently.
<p class="reg-posts">Alongside my desktop PC, I had an <a href="https://laptopmedia.com/gb/laptop-specs/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-150/" 
                                target="_blank"

                     that I use for university work. My desktop PC resided in another part of the house since at this point, I didn't believe that
                     a desk of a usable size would fit. However, with some dedication and time with a tape measure, some new plans had been made.
                     This is what the bedroom setup looked pre-upgrades:</p>

					 alt="This is an image of my old computer setup in my bedroom">
<p class="reg-posts">With some needed upgrades, this little corner of my bedroom has been transformed into the ultimate piece of my personal man cave.
					 I decided to go for a black and wood theme. The upgrades of which being:</p>
<p class="reg-posts">- A fresh coat of paint. A cool grey with a black accent wall
				 <br>- Black desk with wood worktop
				 <br>- Invision Single Monitor Arm
				 <br>- LG 34" 1440p Curved Ultrawide 75Hz (Overclocked to 85Hz) monitor
				 <br>- Blue Snowball Microphone
				 <br>- Custom Keyboard (Lucky65 Kit, Coconut Latte Switches, Womier Caps)
				 <br>- Logitech G305 (Same Mouse From Previous Setup)</p>
<p class="reg-posts">With all these upgrades, the bedroom setup now looks like this: </p>

<p class="reg-posts">The child in me is in absolute awe to the beauty of the setup. Though, ironically I still play the same old morrowind, just in
					 glorious ultrawide. With this now complete, my man cave has reached it's peak and with this, I leave the usual ending quote</p>
