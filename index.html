<p id="portrait-text">This is me</p>

<p class="reg-center" style="margin-top: 20px;">
    I am Ishan Choudhury and this is my webpage. There's some
    pretty cool stuff here, so thanks for stopping by! P.S. I don't
    normally look this menacing</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 60px;">About Me</h2>

<p class="reg-center">We are unreliable narrators to our own lives. Nevertheless, I will give it my best effort</p>

<ul class="reg-lists">
    <li style="width: 900px; margin: 10px 0;">Video game development is both my hobby and career path. Check out my projects page to see my creations.</li>
    <li style="width: 900px; margin: 10px 0;">Collecting retro consoles and games bring me an indescribable amount of joy. PC titles from the XP era included of course</li>
    <li style="width: 900px; margin: 10px 0;">I would like to say I am a digital minimalist: "It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor." - Seneca</li>
    <li style="width: 900px; margin: 10px 0;">Philosophy deeply interests me, especially the schools of thought: stoicism, taoism and hedonism</li>
    <li style="width: 900px; margin: 10px 0;">Reading is a hobby of mine. Check out my library page</li>
    <li style="width: 900px; margin: 10px 0;">I work part-time as a Barista. Preparing and brewing teas and coffee is weirdly very relaxing</li>
</ul>
